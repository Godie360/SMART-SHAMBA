# SMART SHAMBA

## Problem Statement

In Tanzania, agriculture plays a vital role in the lives of rural farmers who rely on it for food and economic purposes. However, these farmers encounter several obstacles that hinder their productivity. One significant challenge is the limited access to information about weather conditions. Insufficient or excessive rainfall during harvest seasons can lead to substantial crop losses. Additionally, farmers often lack knowledge about effective pest and disease prevention measures, which further reduces their productivity. Moreover, finding appropriate markets to sell their agricultural products and generate profits poses a significant challenge.

## Solution of the Problem (How we solved)

To tackle these issues, the Smart Shamba System was developed in Tanzania. It aims to provide farmers with valuable information to overcome these challenges and enhance their productivity. By accessing `weather forecasts`, farmers can make informed decisions on when and what to plant based on predicted rainfall levels. The system also offers insights on pest and disease management through a `chatbot`, empowering farmers to protect their crops and improve their quality and quantity. Furthermore, the system provides a `marketplace` where farmers can upload their products and connect with customers from different regions, enabling them to secure favorable prices and improve their overall well-being and production levels.

Importantly, the Smart Shamba System caters not only to farmers with internet access but also to those without it. The system has `USSD App` where it contain of menu where farmer may choose regarding to the service he or she want. This will enable farmers who use to 2G (Second Generation) technology to access our service
